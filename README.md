#This is my Contact Form .
## I used pure html,css and js to achieve this project.
###I spent more time in my script.js file as i was still new to the whole js concept.
#### I learnt to work with event listeners in js and i cracked working with js logics.
##### I reminded myself on chaining selectors as i worked with my style.css file.
###### Special thanks to Project Buddies team for pushing me to achieve this coding milestone.
